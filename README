about the TwitMapWeb   http://twitmapshijiehu-env.elasticbeanstalk.com/

For html file:
	
 The first five buttons with text are keywords buttons. When click the keywords button, html will send asynchronous http message with keyword to the server and server will search from database and return the query result to html. When receiving all information, html will show the positions of the twitters on map.
 By sending asynchronous message, the web page do not need to upload every element.

 Other buttons on Map can hide the markers or show the twitter density information in a Heatmap, or delete markers.
